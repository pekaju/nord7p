### My thoughts and project goal
This is my first project with Vue.js. It has a database of customers which communicates with the front through a php backend. Since it is a test project it calls php files from front end by name, and excludes any middleware, that could be updated in the future. 

I did not put too much focus into project structure for now, the main goal for me was to get it to work, and learn a little about a new framework while doing that. 

It does not have any unit tests included.
